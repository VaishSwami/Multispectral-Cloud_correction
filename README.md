# Multispectral-Cloud_correction
Here we provide the codes to correct and calibrate Micasense multispectral images affected by moving cloud cover that result in variability in irradiance during data collection. The irradiance measurements from an on-board downwelling light sensor (DLS) is integrated into the image processing workflow to compute instantaneous irradiance. Then calibration is performed based on irradiance proximity, implemented with the nearest neighbor algirithm.
